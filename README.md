# Predicting Solar Power Output

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting solar power output based on environmental factors and appliance energy consumption data. The model is developed using Python and trained using machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between temperature and energy consumption.

## Dataset
The dataset (`appliance_energy.xls`) contains:
- Temperature (°C)
- Energy Consumption (kWh)

## Features and Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection
   
2. **Model Training**
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
   - Implementing a Linear Regression model
   - Training the model using historical energy data

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assessing model performance using RMSE and R² score
   - Visualizing predicted vs actual values

## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook and dataset.
2. Open `predictingsolarpoweroutput.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Adjust hyperparameters to improve predictions.

## Results and Insights
- The model predicts solar power output based on temperature and energy consumption.
- Visualizations provide insights into data patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with advanced regression techniques or neural networks.
- Expand dataset with more environmental factors.
- Deploy the model as an interactive web application.
